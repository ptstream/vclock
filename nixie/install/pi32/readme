To create a Debian installer a shell command is provided.

1. Launch build.sh to create the ".../QtUPnP/aivctrl/install/linux64/Output/debian/usr/aivctrl" folder containing all files to run aivctrl.
   It contains also "aivctrl.desktop" the shortcut to launch aivctrl and "aivctrl.run.desktop" to launch aivctrl.run. 
   aivctrl.desktop is used when all Qt dependencies are SATISFIED (e.g. Kubuntu 17.10).
   aivctrl.run.desktop is used when all Qt dependencies are UNSATISFIED (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS).
   
2. The Debian package is created ".../QtUPnP/aivctrl/install/linux64/Output". Also a zip file is created to use without installer.
