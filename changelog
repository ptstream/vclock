version 0.0.2
- Improvements
  * Add digit test at startup and in the menu. Just for the fun.
  
- Bugs
  * Fix no sound is emitted when using player vlc.
    The problem is that vlc cannot run at root level. But to change the Rapsberry PI 3 brightness
	it is mandatory to work at root level. I add a simple code to drop privileges when vlc is start.
    Only Rapsberry PI 3 is concerned.
	
  * Startup from a timer. The Windows system is not able to bind the vbo in the main window constructor. I move this initialization
    later with a timer. It is not strictly a bug but this generate console messages about vbo only under Windows.

version 0.0.1
- Improvements
  * Remove some warnings generated by gcc 7.

- Bugs
  * Fix crash when the application closes

- Known problems
  * The table texture is not taken into account on Raspberry PI 3.
