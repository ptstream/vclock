version 0.0.2
- Improvements
  * Add digit test at startup and in the menu. Just for the fun.
  
- Bugs
  * Fix no sound is emitted when using player vlc.
    The problem is that vlc cannot run at root level. But to change the Rapsberry PI 3 brightness
	it is mandatory to work at root level. I add a simple code to drop privileges when vlc is start.
    Only Rapsberry PI 3 is concerned.

version 0.0.1
- Improvements

- Bugs
